main.cpp output:
The length of the longest word in the file is: 1065
The number of valid passwords in the file is: 921
Number of valid dictionary words that don't contain your Halloween candies
abbreviations: 573316

Explanation:
a). This function open file, reads each word, and keeps track of the maximum word length found.
b). This function open file, reads each character, check if it is either a lowercase, an uppercase, or a digit,
and then concatenate into the password. If the next character is a space, then it would check whether the password is valid.
If it does, then increment the password counter.
c). This function open the dictionary file, reach each line and loads the words that contain fewer than 3 of the characters 
's', 'p', and 'k' (lowercase and uppercase) into a Trie. Then it reads each word from the file, create substrings, 
and check if each substring exists in the Dictionary Trie. If a substring is found in the Trie, it increments a counter.
If substring is found in a file and it is in the leaf, then it would break to generate the substring of the next character.
